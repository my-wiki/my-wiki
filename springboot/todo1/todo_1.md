## Alerts

Alerts are automatically placed whenever you start a paragraph with a special _trigger_ word, that _has_ to be followed by a colon `:` or exclamation mark `!`.

Trigger words are case insensitive, and must be one of the following:

| Type    | Trigger                                                                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Warning | warning, achtung, attention, warnung, atención, guarda, advertimiento, attenzione |
| Note    | note, beachte, nota                                                               |
| Hint    | hint, tip, tipp, hinweis, suggerimento                                            |

## Math


### Math inserted to new paragraph

### Inline equations

Inline equations can be inserted by surrounding them with the delimiters `\\(` and `\\)`:

Diameter \\( d \\) of a circle given area \\( A \\) can by obtained via \\(d=\sqrt{\frac{4A}{\pi}}\\)

Will show as: Diameter \\( d \\) of a circle given area \\( A \\) can by obtained via \\(d=\sqrt{\frac{4A}{\pi}}\\)
